# api-testing
This repository describes how we can test our API's quickly and easily!

To get start fork and clone the repository and ensure your postgres server is running
already!

 Next run the following command:

`sh ./setup.sh`

You can start the server by running `npm start` and you can run the tests
with `npm test`
